CORE CONCEPTS
-------------

Workspaces:
A workspace is your company's home in TechFlow. All your projects, teams,
and settings live here. You can have multiple workspaces if you work with
different organizations.

Projects:
Projects are containers for related work. Each project has its own board,
timeline, and team members. Examples: "Q1 Marketing Campaign", "Mobile App v2.0",
"Customer Onboarding".

Tasks:
Tasks are the basic unit of work. Each task has:
- Title and description
- Assignee (who's responsible)
- Due date
- Priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- Labels (for categorization)
- Comments (for discussion)
- Attachments (files, images)

Columns/Stages:
Tasks move through stages like "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Done".
You can customize these stages for each project.
