Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing rules manually, machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions.

Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data. Each example in the training set includes both the input and the desired output (label). Common applications include spam detection, image classification, and price prediction.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data without any guidance about what to look for. It discovers hidden structures in data. Examples include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. It's used in game playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

Key Concepts

- Features: The input variables used to make predictions
- Labels: The output variable being predicted (in supervised learning)
- Training: The process of teaching a model using data
- Inference: Using a trained model to make predictions on new data
- Overfitting: When a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize
- Underfitting: When a model is too simple to capture patterns in the data

Popular Algorithms

Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values by finding the best-fit line
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems
Decision Trees: Make decisions based on asking a series of questions
Random Forests: Ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy
Neural Networks: Inspired by the human brain, excellent for complex patterns
Support Vector Machines: Find the optimal boundary between classes
